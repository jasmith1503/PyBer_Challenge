# PyBer_Challenge

## Overview of the analysis: 
Using the two .csv files profiled (see list) compile the information into one “main” dataframe which will be used to determine a variety of statistical information. 

•	City_data.csv – Breakdown of specific cities in the dataset along with the PyBer drivers linked to each city. Each city also has a categorical breakdown of “Rural”, “Suburban”, & “Urban”
•	Ride_data.csv – Breakdown of each ride given by a PyBer driver which corresponds to the cities listed in City_data.csv. The fare for the ride along with the specific “ride_id” is detailed. 

## Results: 
The data concludes that he Average Fare per ride for Rural drivers is higher than the drivers in the Urban area. The data indicates that the distance between the ride start and end locations are greater leading to a higher Fare cost vs the lower Average Fare per Ride in Urban areas. This leads to the conclusion that the distance between start and stops are much shorter making the average cost go down. In the middle were Suburban areas Fares in the middle. 
The Driver counts for Urban areas was almost 3 times as high vs Suburban drivers and over 10 times the amounts vs Rural drivers.
